HW 9

We were able to fully complete requirements 1 - 7.

Concerning point 8, we have support for < redirection, but unfortunately > redirection is still proving a problem for us.

Unfortunately, we were also unable to do | redirection of any kind (points 10 and 11).

This README and the associated Makefile satisfy point 11.

We added color and the CWD above to typable area so a user (e.g. you) can quickly
see critical information. This is modeled after themes from the OhMyZSH! theme project.

I affirm that I have adhered to the Honor Code on this assignment.
